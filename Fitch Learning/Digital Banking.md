At the end of 20th century, transaction processing, data storage, management and analysis have been upgraded online, reaching a rapid development of automated processes for cheque payments.

- Credit card was first invented in the 1950s, facilitated by the development of computerized system. **It's not linked to a bank account but billed and settled regularly.**
- Debit card was first introduced in the 1980s.

Both types of cards can be used to make low-value contactless payments with the help of **Near Field Communication** (or **NFC**) technology.

### Postal & Telephone Banking

Telephone banking begins from the 1980s.

## Digital Currency

A currency available in a digital rather than a physical form, which is **the most common form of money in developed world**. <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">Currency is a medium of exchange accepted by both the buyer and the seller as having an agreed value.</span>

Legal tender is the digital currency issued by a State / Central Bank, while virtual currencies derive value from the market supply and demands.

It is not just the currency of the realm that may be digitized, several virtual currencies exist which are not supported by any central bank or associated underlying economy. These virtual currencies may be classified as either **open** or **closed**.

- **Closed virtual currency** &mdash; incapable of being translated into any legal tender, making these currencies unsuitable as a general medium of payments beyond their intended narrow use.
- **Open virtual currency** &mdash; capable of two-way translation with a legal tender, making these currencies quite suitable as a general medium of payment for those who are prepared to accept them.

Bitcoin, a open virtual currency issued in January 2009, is acknowledged to be the first decentralized/open virtual currency or crypto-currency. It is based on the blockchain distributed ledger system and operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with transactions taking place directly between trading counterparties.
