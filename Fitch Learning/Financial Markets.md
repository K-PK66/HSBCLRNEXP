# Financial Markets

4 major financial markets are:

- Equity
- Debt
- Foreign exchange (or FX)
- Derivatives

The first 2 markets can be referred to a **capital markets** as issuers can raise capital.

## Investors & Asset Managers

Market participants will sometimes require capital and at other times will have a surplus of capital they wish to invest. They may include...

- Individuals / Households
- Financial institutions <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">banks, asset managers or hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, etc.</span>
- Non-financial companies
- Gov.s and gov. agencies

Capital is primarily raised from either debt <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">creditor loan</span> or equity <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">owner share</span> sources, and investor return objectives are driven by their risk appetitive and time horizons. These objectives will have implications on the investments chosen.

**Asset managers** invest money on behalf of institutional investors as well as individuals, the latter via mutual funds.

### Major Investors

As is categorized above, here are def.s to the 4 types.

#### Individuals / Households

They invest in order to meet their personal portfolio goals, possibly including saving for retirement or planning to meet a child's college fees.

The amount of investable assets they own divides themselves to different sub-categories, e.g. retail clients, high net worth individuals & ultra-high net worth ones, etc.

#### Financial institutions

**The largest investor group,** comprised of those who manage huge sum of capital (e.g. USD 1B) to meet legally defined objectives mandated either by clients or regulators.

#### Non-financial companies

Microbusinesses or large corporations (categorized by the size of their balance sheet and turnover). They invest surplus capital to meet corporate goals.

#### Gov.s

Central banks and sovereign wealth funds who invest FX reserves and budget surpluses respectively.

Primary market is the new issue one which enables issuers to raise new money or capital from investors, and secondary market enables investors to buy and sell seasoned securities without affecting issuer levels of capital unless it is the issuer who buys back and cancels the issued securities from the secondary market. **When retail investors wish to cash in this investment, the investment bank or broker will help them access the secondary market.**

### Source of Investor Capital and Differentiate Between the Return Objectives

#### Equity markets (Stock markets)

**Only companies and financial institutions raise capital in the equity markets.**

Disadvantage for a company of issuing new equity to new shareholders <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">the owners of the company. Also called equity holders or members</span>: **exchanging part of their company for cash**.

Advantage: company **under no obligation at any point in the future to repay or buy back any shares that they have issued**.

Investors may recoup their investment by selling their shares in the secondary markets. Equties are mainly held over a longer-term horizon to generate capital growth above inflation (more than 5 years), income is a nice complement to dividends but never guaranteed.

#### Bond and money markets

Where gov. and corporate capital is raised by issuing debt <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">either tradable or non-tradable loans</span>.

Bond market, also called debt capital market or fixed income market, denotes obligations with an original maturity of 1+ years. Money market are where short-term funds with original maturity of 1- year are invested and raised.

Funds are lent to the issuer and are repaid at a future date in both markets. Companies, financial institutions and gov.s raise long-term capital in bond markets.

Issuing debt...

- Pros &mdash; control of the company is retained and no part of the ownership is given up.
- Cons &mdash; obligation is formed where coupon / interest must legally be paid when due. **Principal must also be legally repaid when due.**

----
##### Basic features of bonds

- Issuer <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">company or gov. raising the finance</span>
- Coupon or coupon rate <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">percentage of the nominal value that the bond pays per year, even if paid more freq.ly</span>
- Redemption or maturity date <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">date upon which the nominal value will be returned to bondholders</span>
- Nominal, principal, face value, par <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">amount that bondholders get repaid at maturity and the amount used to calculate the coupon / interest. Bonds typicially issued with a minimum denomination</span>
- Price <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">percentage of nominal value that the investor pays for the bond today</span>
- Yield (to maturity) <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">approx. percentage return per year the investor receives if they buy the bond and hold it until maturity</span>

Bonds typicially offer a lower-risk investment choice than equities but also a lower expected return. Corporate bonds are categorized as either **Investment Grade** (or **IG**) or **High Yield** (or **HY**) ones.

#### Debt market

Can be categorized into 2 groupings.

##### Bank loans

As the name defines, money is simply borrowed from bank.

Loans...

- [ ] Tradeable
- [x] Packageable into tradable debt securities <span style="color:gray; font-size:50%">mortgage backed securities (or MBS), collateralized loan obligations (or CLOs) or collateralized debt obligations (or CDOs)

### Asset / Fund Managers

Firms that take investment decisions. They may have wide-ranging powers of investment or there may be a narrow range of investments permitted.

Investors choose to invest in a fund as opposed to just managing their own portfolio in that many average investors are **NOT** able to...

- Allocate the time to manage their own portfolios.
- Construct, monitor and adjust their portfolios as they don't have the expertise.
- Benefit from economies of scale.
- Diversify as well as with pooled investments.
- Handle the administration that goes with portfolio management.

Investing in a collective investment may have downsides as follows.

- **Cost** &mdash; services provided by management group do not come cheap.
- **Guarantee-less** &mdash; funds managed are often diversified but returns are not guaranteed.
- **Lack of control** &mdash; all decision making is handed over to a manager. Even if they are great, they are still unlikely to stay managing the same fund forever.

## Issuers & Primary Markets

Companies issue shares or bonds to raise cash or capital, trading in 2 different markets called primary and secondary.

Issues into the primary market occur when a company is seeking to **raise long-term terminal from investors** &mdash; new shares or bonds are therefore issued by the company in return for finance from investors. Secondary market trading is the market in second-hand shares and bonds. In the secondary market, no new finance is raised by the company as the **trading is done directly between investors**.

### Main Users of Capital

**Companies issue shares or bonds to raise cash or capital,** traded in either primary market or secondary one.

- Primary market issues &mdash; company seeking to raise long-term capital from investors
- Secondary market issues &mdash; *second-hand* shares and bonds, **no new finance raised**

In the primary markets there can be secondary issues &mdash; this is where a company that has already raised capital by issuing shares chooses to make a subsequent issue (or follow on issue) of shares.

### Major Gov.s Issue Bonds via Auctions

**Major gov.s offer bonds in the primary markets via an auction where it collects bids from interested parties and issues them to the successful bidders.**

#### Bond Auctions

Dealers <span style="color: gray; font-size: 50%">investment banks</span> place bids for the bond and the successful bidders pay the price at which they bid.

Suppose the auction is for 1M British pounds nominal basing on **gilt issuance**, proposed by DMO. Bids from dealers and the result whether they can be awarded the bond are as follows:

- [x] A offers to buy 0.3M nominal and is willing to pay £100.95 for every 100 nominal.
- [x] B offers to buy 0.7M nominal and is willing to pay £100.85 for every 100 nominal.
- [ ] C offers to buy 0.5M nominal and is willing to pay £100.60 for every 100 nominal.

Since issuance has been bought by A and B, there's nothing left for C.

Suppose another auction for 1M British pounds nominal basing on **Treasury bond issuance**, proposed by US Fed. Bids from dealers are same with above, but in this situation both A and B are awarded the bonds in the lower price of £100.85 in that the price is **the lowest accepted bid price (also the highest price at which all the bonds can be sold)**.

This is a key parameter for analysts following the US Treasury bond auction. Usually, a bid-to-cover-ratio of above 2.0 indicates a successful auction with highly competitive bids with narrow spreads in the bid yields.

### Corporate Bonds

When corporate bonds are issued, they may be sold as an open offer for sale or directly to a small number of professional investors (a **private placing**).  

The former involves a syndicate of banks with one as lead manager buying the bonds and then reselling them to investors. The sale of these bonds is typically underwritten by the banks (who naturally charge for this service based on the amount guaranteed). Underwriting offers the issuer a guarantee that a specified level of capital will be raised in the issue – even if this means that the underwriter has to buy some or all of the bonds themselves.  If this guarantee is not provided by the bank, then sale is called best efforts, where the bank is only broking for the client. 

If the lead bank buys all the bonds and sells them to a collection of issuing bonds (the syndicate), this is called a bought deal.  The syndicate members could then sell the bonds on at varying prices.  

More usually, the lead manager and the syndicate buy the bonds together and offer them at a fixed price for a certain period (a **fixed price re-offering**). 

### Types of offers

- **Offer for subscription** &mdash; Company directly issue shares to general public, typically used by larger issuers
- **Offer for sale** &mdash; Issuing house initially buys up new shares from the company before reselling them to the investing community, basing on the price of a similar company's security already trading in the market, also used for a large shareholding being sold into the market place
- **Offer for sale by tender** &mdash; Issuing house invites investors to tender bids for the company's shares. Interested investors make bids and issuing house selects applications with the highest bids (with a minimum acceptable bid). Once all bids received, an acceptable price will be determined from them, successful applicants will pay a common strike price.

### Offer Reviewings

- **Accelerated book building** &mdash; An investment firm canvasses existing institutional clients about their interest in a company’s shares. The investment firm then build a book of interested parties. This is typically done over a short period of time – days or even overnight – hence the term "accelerated".
- **Placing (Selective Marketing)** &mdash; Similar to an offer for sale, as it uses an issuing house to market the issuing companies’ shares. However, the issuing house does not offer to resell the shares to the investing community at large, instead, the shares are only offered to selected investors such as asset managers and wealthy individuals.
- **Underwriting** &mdash; a means of guaranteeing a minimum level of proceeds from a share issue. The cost of the guarantee is a fee, payable to the underwriter (normally an investment bank). In the event that demand is insufficient to generate the minimum level of proceeds, the underwriter agrees to take up any shortfall, paying cash for the unwanted stock. 

## Liquidity and Execution

### Investors & Secondary Markets

Secondary markets allow investors to cash their holdings and exit a position and new investors to enter the market to meet their objectives.

Trading can happen via a quote-driven or order-driven mechanism.

- **Quote-driven** &mdash; participants advertise **2 prices** at which they'll buy and sell, called a bid or an offer/ask. Investors will buy at the higher offer price and sell at the lower bid price, thereby earning the spread for the dealer.
- **Order-driven** &mdash; participants advertise **1 price** at which they'll trade, either a bid or an offer/ask but not both.

In quote-driven market, if a dealer advertises 127/126, he's going to sell the shares at price 126 and buy at 127.

In order-driven market, for example, Karen could have posted her stock on an online auction site at 105 US dollars (offer). Here, Joe sees the stock, bids the amount asked and the transaction is executed. Both Karen and Joe saved themselves 5 US dollars compared to dealing with the market maker. The auction site is an order-driven exchange and acts as an agent charging commission on the transaction (to both Karen and Joe). However, this system relies on having a willing buyer and seller at all times at the price shown. If Joe was not interested, Karen would not be able to sell quickly at a reasonable price. If Karen was not interested, Joe would not be able to buy quickly at a reasonable price.

Quote-driven systems require a market maker to guarantee liquidity, but order-driven ones do not require the maker despite the needs for liquidity. The order-driven systems enables many investors to independently enter either buy or sell orders which can then be matched by the order book algorithm.

### Exchange order book

When a broker or dealer places a trade order, they interact with the exchange order book. This is what an exchange order book looks like on Bloomberg.

```plaintext
               161.63
     BID                    ASK
Size     Price        Price     Size
1572  4  161.55      161.70  5  5178
6900  1  161.50      161.75  3  22115
5598  1  161.45      161.80  4  79281
 ... ... ...            ... ... ...
```

As is illustrated, there is a total of 4 orders making up 1572 shares being bid at the best bid price of 161.55 &mdash; anyone entering a sell order for 2000 shares with no price limit would end up with 1572 shares at 161.55 and 428 shares at 161.50 each. Also, there is a total of 5 orders making up 5178 shares being offered at the best ask/offer price of 161.70.

Usually, the best bid-offer for the market is shown in a yellow touch strip. Orders behind the best bid-offer, also known as *market depth*, are investors waiting for the price to move in their favor before their orders are executed. For example, those trying to sell at 161.80 should wait for a positive market event that will drive the price up. Generally orders on the booked are ranked by price and then time.
