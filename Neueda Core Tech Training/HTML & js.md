# HTML, CSS & Javascript

## Overview

### HTML

HTML4 first emerged in 1999, which is standardized by the Worldwide Web Consortium (or W3C). HTML5 launched in 2007 and introduced several new features (e.g. native audio & video, new input controls, graphics, geolocation, web sockets, web stroage, web workers and Ajax improvements), simplifying DOCTYPE declarations.

### CSS

Having been introduced in HTML4, CSS allows developers to define styles for HTML elements.

### Javascript

A scripting language usually embedded directly (or linked) into HTML pages. It's used to make HTML pages interactive, react to events, update the content of the HTML document and validate data before it's submitted to a server in order to save unnecessary roundtrips.

> HTML defines the template of a web page while CSS defines the page's theme, styles and color, and Javascript provides support for user-interactive events.
